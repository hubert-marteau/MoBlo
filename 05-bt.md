# 5.    Business Transactions \(BT\)

Previous parts of this document have an architecture approach. They give elements to determinate the population, the software architecture and the data architecture. This part gives a point of view more business-related.

This part presents the transactions that will make sense in the BlockChain. Assuming that the technical part of a transaction is valid, a transaction carries data in the BlockChain that can be used in non-currency use case, then the transaction has to be coherent.

## 5.1.    Modelization

Each transaction has an origin and a destination. Each transaction carries more or less data.

![](/Img/BT-SimpleTransaction.png)

_**Figure 5-1 - BT - Simple Transaction**_

In the represented transaction, Alice sends to Bob units of the _Asset Aj_ with a complement of data _dk_ using the transaction _ti_.

![](/Img/BT-MultiSig.png)

_**Figure 5-2 - BT - MultiSig Transaction**_

In the case of MultiSign Addresses, origin can be easily specified. Here Alice and Bob send to Carol, 10 units of _A5_ and 6 units of _A12_ by the transaction _tz_.

The identification of transaction takes importance when the sense comes from successive transactions, then triggers can be identified.

## 5.2.    Library use case BT

The Library use case presents a lot of possible transactions.

![](/Img/BT-Library-SignUp.png)

_**Figure 5-3 - BT - Library - Sign Up**_

_Readers_ use a Web Gate to access to the Information System. Then, when a new _Reader_ wants to sign up, he uses the Web Gate. Here the arrow is dotted to indicate that it is not a BlockChain transaction. The modelization of such a transaction can be useful to completely describe the use case and remind the importance of the Web Gate.

![](/Img/BT-Library-Distrib.png)

_**Figure 5-4 - BT - Library - Distribution**_

The _Central Library_ creates the _Assets_ and the units of _Asset_. When, in the real life, the book is sent to a _Library \(L\)_, the _Central Library \(CL\)_ has to send a unit of the _Asset_ to the _Library_.

![](/Img/BT-Library-Central.png)

_**Figure 5-5 - BT - Library - Centralisation**_

Books can be returned in any library. Then a library can stored many copies of the same book. The books have to be sent to the _Central Library_.

The booking of a particular book can be a reason too. A book is available in only one copy. If someone wants to read it, the book has to be transferred from a Library to another one passing by _Central Library_.

Anyway, the BlockChain indicates where the available books are located.

![](/Img/BT-Library-Loaning.png)

_**Figure 5-6 - BT - Library - Loaning**_

A _Reader \(R\)_ can borrow a book. The book is then taken from a Library \(_Central Library_ or other _Library_\) and sent to the _Reader_. The transaction can carry the End Date of the loan.

![](/Img/BT-Library-Return.png)

_**Figure 5-7 - BT - Library - Return**_

The simple cycle of book can be ended with the case of the return. A _Reader_ returns a book, and the unit is sent back to the _Library_.

At this point, the system is a ledger which allows to know where a book is located.

![](/Img/BT-Library-Booking.png)

_**Figure 5-8 - BT - Library - Booking**_

Here is a sequential use case, where transactions have a related number to indicate the order which has to be followed.

The _Booking_ allows the _Readers_ to ask for a specific book in a specific library. Remind that _Readers_ can only use the Web Gate and only the Central Library can create _Assets_ and _Asset_ units.

The _Reader \(R\)_ asks for a book using the Web Gate. One unit of the _Asset Booking \(K\)_ is sent from the _Central Library_ to the destination _Library \(L\)_ asked by the _Reader_. The transaction carries on information about the _Booking_ \(book reference, destination library …\)

Now the system knows that the book is waited in a particular _Library_. The first case is “The book is already in the library”, and then there is nothing to do. The second case is “The book is only available in another library” and then batches take care to return the book to _Central Library_ and then distribute it to the destination _Library_.

When the book is available in the destination library, this _Library_ sends the unit of _Booking_ to the _Reader_ to notify him that the book is waiting for him in the _Library_. At the end, when the Reader comes to loan the book, the unit of _Booking_ is returned to _Central Library_.

Notice that the first step of _Booking_ is done after using Web Gate. A business part has to be implemented. In this part, a rule can specify how many _Bookings_ can be done by the same _Reader_ at the same time. But, this rule doesn’t appear in this BlockChain modelization.

![](/Img/BT-Library-Delay.png)

_**Figure 5-9 - BT - Library - Delay**_

The last part of the use case is the _Delay_ in book return. Transactions are created by the batches which are using the _Central Library_ address based on loaning information. When a book is loaned, the end date is specified, the system easily allows to find Books loaned by _Readers_ out of End Date.

In this case, one unit of _Delay_ is sent to the _Reader \(R\)_ from the _Central Library \(CL\)_ with a reference on the book out of date.

When the _Reader_ returns the book, he sends to the _Library_ the unit of _Book_ and the unit of _Delay_.

## 5.3.    Forum use case BT

Forum is a simplest use case limited to two cases: open a new subject and comment an existing subject.

![](/Img/BT-Forum-NewSubj.png)

_**Figure 5-10 - BT - Forum - New Subject**_

The creation of a new subject is defined by the creation of a new _Asset_. It can be done by the _Forum Creator \(FC\)_ or an _Editor \(E\)_. When a new subject is opened, the _Publisher_ creates a new _Asset \(Sni\)_ and sends one unit of the _Asset_ to the _Publication Wall_. The transaction carries on the publication which can be read anyone able to connect to the BlockChain.

![](/Img/BT-Forum-Comment.png)

_**Figure 5-11 - BT - Forum - Comment**_

The _Creator_ of an _Asset_ is the owner of this _Asset_. He is then the only one able to create new units of the _Asset_.

In the Forum use case, the interest is to track Subjects and comments on the Subjects. For that, the same _Assets_ are used to create the subject and comment it. To comment a publication, people need to ask one unit of the _Asset_ to the _Creator_ of the publication.

_Someone \(P\)_ who wants to comment create a transaction only with data. The data indicates what is the Subject to be commented is and what is the transaction to be commented. The transaction is sent to the address of the _Creator of the Subject \(FC/E\)_.

If the _Creator_ of the _Subject_ decides to allow the comment, then he sends to _\(P\)_ one unit of the _Asset_ referencing the transaction used to ask this unit.

At the end, _\(P\)_ can send his comment to the _Publication Wall_ using the unit of _Asset_, referencing the transaction to comment and giving his comment.
